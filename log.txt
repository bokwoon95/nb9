TODO: investigate why sq is dumping repeated sql.NamedArgs into the args slice.
TODO: debug why listRootDirectory is showing every entry as a zero value. The SQL query is alright, it returns 5 non-empty results. But the JSON is showing 5 empty fileEntries. Something is wrong with the sq library.
TODO: Implement the "undeleteable files" index.html, post.html and postlist.html. When are they created? How are they maintained?
TODO: before moving off file_handler, experiment with the SQLite backend for RemoteFS.
TODO: /users/language/?redirect=foo/bar/baz which lets people set the language code in a cookie and redirects them back to the page. Every page is language-aware by pulling out the language code from the cookie. And then in the notebrew navbar we have a little language switcher icon (a globe) that simply links to /users/language/.
TODO: main.go: for filesDB on SQLite, we should set the page size to 8192 instead for best blob performance (https://www.sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html)
TODO: under what circumstances do we rewrite user links to CDN links? I can think of two scenarios where it is undesirable: when you're hosting the CMS on localhost and rewriting relative links to CDN links would break local preview, and when you're targeting a static site and any reference to an external host is likely to break unless you also set that up as well.
    I think the resolution is, keep CDN links manual first (don't automatically rewrite anything). That way when we finally deploy to live we can experiment with fetching a page without CDN links and fetching a page with CDN links and seeing which does better (and by how much).

TODO: because PWA Web Share Target API is so gimped, I'll probably have to forget the PWA route entirely (that means forgoing the notebtrew.webmanifest and apple-touch-icon.png special handling in serve_http.go -- and we can remove .webmanifest from the fileTypes map entirely) and resorting to an app wrapper in the future instead.
