TODO: work on listDirectory so that we can switch over to fileHandler() asap and remove file.go/directory.go.
    TODO: listRootDirectory: use from=xxx&limit=1000 and before=xxxx&limit=1000
TODO: list_root_directory.html: separate the site folders into its own separate section with a "sites" header (non-link).
    Move the "+ create site" button down to the site folders section.
    Now it becomes clear that pagination only works on the site folders, the normal folders are always on top. And when we are in a site folder the site folder section goes away entirely.
    More importantly, this aligns with how we implement displaying the root directory: first we pull out the normal folders, then we iterate the site folders.
TODO: /users/language/?redirect=foo/bar/baz which lets people set the language code in a cookie and redirects them back to the page. Every page is language-aware by pulling out the language code from the cookie. And then in the notebrew navbar we have a little language switcher icon (a globe) that simply links to /users/language/.
TODO: main.go: for filesDB on SQLite, we should set the page size to 8192 instead for best blob performance (https://www.sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html)
TODO: under what circumstances do we rewrite user links to CDN links? I can think of two scenarios where it is undesirable: when you're hosting the CMS on localhost and rewriting relative links to CDN links would break local preview, and when you're targeting a static site and any reference to an external host is likely to break unless you also set that up as well.
