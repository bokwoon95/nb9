TODO: when serving files, allocate a special case for handling *os.File: an *os.File can be rewinded (bypassing the need to store the file in a *bytes.Buffer just to calculate the hash, we can rewind it), and it can be served by http.ServeContent far more efficiently than a *bytes.Buffer using sendfile.

TODO: when serving files, allocate a special case for handling *RemoteFile, as it allows us to potentially obtain the entirety of the file body without having to stream into an intermediate *bytes.Buffer.
