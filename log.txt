    source file is directly correlated to an index.html in its output/posts/* folder
    output folder can contain .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .webp, .gif files (just regard all files?)

TODO: big turn: remove clipboard (cut/copy/paste). condense "site/list settings" and "regenerate site/list" back into a miscellaneous dropdown button, because we will need to accomodate an "upload file" link as well and there's no space.
    - Uploading files only works for individual files, it doesn't work for folders. If there is a file conflict it simply backs off for that file and refuses to overwrite.
    - Uploaded files do trigger page/post/postlist regeneration when appropriate.
    - All files have a little "download" button in the dropdown menu. You can use checkboxes to select multiple files to download. You can only download files not folders, for feature parity with uploading files.
TODO: Import/Export? How to handle?
TODO: clipboard.go get paste to work
TODO: also add the regenerate list button to the output page of a post category
TODO: structured template error
    We *have* to parse out template errors because that's the only way we can adjust the line number by the number of lines we add at the start of the template (if we added any).
    ParseTemplate() error => parseTemplate() (numPrefixLines int, err error)
    If we assume template errors follow this format: "template: {filePath}:{lineNr}: {errmsg}", we can parse template errors accordingly and send it out as structured JSON objects instead of plain strings, which would allow us to highlight the problematic lines in the codemirror editor.
    {
        "abcd.html": [
            {"line": 3, "msg": "unclosed action"},
            {"line": 5, "msg": "unterminated quoted string"},
            {"line": 10, "msg": "executing \"abcd.html\" at <throw>: wrong number of args for throw: want 1 got 0"},
        ]
    }
    - parse and execution errors always contain only one line number, because html/template stops at the first error
    - internal templates ending in html can be multiple errors. these have no line number.
    - external templates not starting with /themes/ can be multiple errors. these have no line number.
    - external templates ending in a circular reference can be multiple errors. these have no line number.
    - external templates that don't exist can only be one error. these have no line number.
    - external templates being a dir instead of a file can only be one error. these have no line number.
    Given the massive number of error types with no line number, maybe it is better to just not highlight line numbers?
TODO: rename.go
TODO: download.go
    - "download" becomes a new contextual button users can use on selected files, just like cut/copy/delete.
    - a new "download site" button becomes added to a site, which people can use to export their site folders (and upload it back using plain old uploadfile).
    - a corresponding "upload files" option becomes available in the plus icon dropdown menu (separated from create file/create folder by a <hr>).
TODO: rewrite the cookie handling portion of directory.js to mirror the sort/order logic on the server.
TODO: /users/language/?redirect=foo/bar/baz which lets people set the language code in a cookie and redirects them back to the page. Every page is language-aware by pulling out the language code from the cookie. And then in the notebrew navbar we have a little language switcher icon (a globe) that simply links to /users/language/.
    NOTE: for languages don't parse all the language json files and keep them in memory, instead implement a TTL using timers and timer.Reset everytime someone requests for that language file. Once the timer expires, delete it from the map.
    BEFORE YOU DO THIS: look at how big the language files are. If it's an acceptable cost to keep them all in memory then just keep it in memory and reads will be much faster since you don't have to guard reads behind a mutex.
TODO: a little "view data" link on file.html that simply the href "?data". When clicked, it generates live data of the page in real time if we're on a page.html, or the latest post/last page data if we're on post.html/postlist.html.

NOTE: `notebrew regenerate` will regenerate all sites. `notebrew regenerate -site ''` will only regenerate the base site. This is great if you change the ImgDomain and need to regenerate all pages in all sites to keep image links up-to-date.
