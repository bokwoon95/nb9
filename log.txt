TODO: FS should include MkdirAll and RemoveAll and ReadDir and exclude all the fancy file iteration methods WalkDir and ScanDir.
    - We will handwrite an optimized versions of GeneratePage/GeneratePost/GeneratePostList for RemoteFS by type asserting an FS into *RemoteFS and using its internal db directly to execute the most efficient WalkDir/ScanDir possible.
    - We can walk the files in reverse so that we can generate all pages in a single pass.
    - We can efficiently get all the category directories by explicitly filtering by is_dir.
    - We can directly paginate the files table efficiently with SQL queries instead of hiding everything behind ScanDirAfterX and ScanDirBeforeX.
TODO: when serving files, allocate a special case for handling *os.File: an *os.File can be rewinded (bypassing the need to store the file in a *bytes.Buffer just to calculate the hash, we can rewind it), and it can be served by http.ServeContent far more efficiently than a *bytes.Buffer using sendfile.

TODO: when serving files, allocate a special case for handling *RemoteFile, as it allows us to potentially obtain the entirety of the file body without having to stream into an intermediate *bytes.Buffer.
